# Challenge Title
So in this challenge, we're going to be building a linked list data structure and testing it using automated tests. Our linked list should be able to do some important things, like adding new nodes to the beginning or end of the list, removing nodes, and searching for specific values. To make sure our code is clean and easy to understand, we're going to follow the Single-responsibility principle and write reusable code that's easy to read



## Approach & Efficiency
| Function | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| `insert` | O(1)           | O(1)             |
| `includes` | O(n)         | O(1)             |
| `to_string` | O(n)        | O(n)             |
