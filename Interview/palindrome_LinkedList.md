# code Challenge 09
the code checks whether a given singly linked list is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a sequence of characters or values that reads the same forwards as it does backward, such as "racecar" or the sequence of values in a linked list. The function is_palindrome takes the head of the linked list as input and returns True if the linked list is a palindrome and False otherwise.

## Approach & Efficiency
| Function          | Time Complexity | Space Complexity|
| -------------     | -------------- | ---------------|
| `insert`          | O(1)           | O(1)           |

| `includes`        | O(n)         | O(1)             |
| `toString`        | O(n)         | O(n)             |
